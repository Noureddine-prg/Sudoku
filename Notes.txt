Used this:

- A HashSet, similar to a Dictionary, is a hash-based collection, so look ups are very fast with O(1). 
  But unlike a dictionary, it doesn't store key/value pairs; it only stores values.So, every objects should be 
  unique and this is determined by the value returned from the GetHashCode method.
